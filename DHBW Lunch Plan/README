Hello,

This repository contains scripts that were written back in 2008. 
They access the lunch menu of the DHBW Mannheim in Germany and
convert it into a nicer-looking version that I used to display on my Desktop.

At the time of this post (Autumn 2010) they still worked, however I do no 
longer maintain them. If the DHBW site changes, the scripts will break.

Try them out!
